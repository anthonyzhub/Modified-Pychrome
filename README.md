**Friendly Message**:

Hi All,

This program is built upon Pychromecast with additional features for any kind of user. It does not matter if you are a beginner or expert programmer. Everyone is welcomed to use it! 

Pychromecast was created by ballooob, who was generous to share their group's project to the Github community. It allows users to access and stream personal content to the user's Google devices. Feel free to check out his work (Link: https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast). 

My main goal is giving an easy access to all computer scientist enthusiast, no matter the skill level, who would love to watch their homemade videos on their chromecast. Modified-Pychrome allow users to stream any media files from your computer to any Google device. Controlling the media content is available through an interactive console. Only minimal modifications are required in the program for all users. More details are available below.

Have fun streaming,

Anthony

**Instructions**:

1. Open `Terminal` and navigate to the folder with the files you want to stream
2. Type and enter `python3 -m http.server`
3. Open Broadcast.py and specify directory of the folder from Step 1 in `addMediaFiles()`. Save changes!
4. Execute `Main.py` in either Terminal or IDE
5. Select Google device by either typing device's name or number associated with it
6. Similar to previous step, but with media files involving an interactive console
7. The console will print out another message: `[pause, play, stop, terminate]`. These commands are similar to a remote of any T.V. However, `terminate` will stop the program from running internally. Enter any command, it is an interactive console
8. Sit back and relax!
