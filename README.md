Hi All,

This program is built upon Pychromecast with additional features for any kind of user. It does not matter if you are a beginner or expert programmer, everyone is welcome to use it! 

Pychromecast was created by ballooob, who was generous to share their group's project to the Github community. His program allows users to access and stream personal content to their own Google devices. Feel free to check out his work (Link: https://github.com/balloob/pychromecast). 

Modified-Pychrome's main goal is to give an easy access to all computer scientist enthusiast, no matter the skill level, who would love to watch their homemade videos on their chromecast. Modified-Pychrome allow users to stream any media files from your computer to any Google device. Controlling the media content is available through an interactive console. Only minimal modifications are required in the program for all users. More details are available below.

Have fun streaming,

Anthony

**Instructions**:

1. Open `Terminal` and navigate to your media folder
2. Type and enter `python3 -m http.server` to start server
3. Execute `Main.py` in either Terminal or IDE
4. If this is the first time `Modified Pychromecast` is running in your computer, enter directory of folder that has all the media files that you would like to cast. This is case sensitive!
5. Select a Google device by either typing device's name or number associated with it
6. Similar to previous step, but involves in selecting a media file through an interactive console
